# SQL-VIEWS

A view is a virtual table that is generated from a query that is named and stored in the catalog view,  which later the table value of the query results can be used later by other queries.
	
	Some view properties:
	1. 1 view only consists of one query.
	2. When you want to create a view, there must be no other statements in the query.
	3. View is used for re-usable query needs.
	4. In the database, the view does not store the results, but only stores the query.
